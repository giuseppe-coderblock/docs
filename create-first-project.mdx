Before you can create your first project, you need to access Coderblock.

1. Go to [coderblock.ai](http://coderblock.ai) and click **Sign Up** if you’re new, or **Log In** if you already have an account.
2. You can quickly access using **Google**, **GitHub**, or **email**.
3. Once logged in, you’ll be taken to your **Project Hub**, where all your projects are listed.
