## Step 1: Sign in or Sign up

Before you can create your first project, you need to access Coderblock.

1. Go to [coderblock.ai](http://coderblock.ai) and click **Sign Up** if you’re new, or **Log In** if you already have an account.
2. You can quickly access using **Google**, **GitHub**, or **email**.
3. Once logged in, you’ll be taken to your **Project Hub**, where all your projects are listed.

<Tip>
  **Tip**: using GitHub or Google accounts makes login faster and easier.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Write your first prompt

Coderblock lets you create a full-stack app just by describing it in a sentence.

- Click **New Project** and give it a name.
- In the prompt box, type something simple, for example:

```
Build a to-do app with user authentication.
```

- Press **Generate** and watch Coderblock turn your prompt into a working app.

<Tip>
  **Tip**: start simple. You can always add features later.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Generate & preview

Once you click **Generate**:

1. The AI agent creates your **UI**, **backend logic**, and **data models** automatically.
2. Your app appears in the **Preview panel**. You can interact with it as if it were live.
3. If you’re happy with the result, click **Save** to store your project in the Project Hub.

<Tip>
  **Tip**: don’t worry if it’s not perfect on the first try. You can edit prompts or code to refine it instantly.
